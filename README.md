# TZ-Gaming-Targeting-of-Mobile-Ads
# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing ad targeting for TZ Gaming, a mobile game developer, using advanced data science techniques. The primary objective was to improve customer acquisition and retention by enhancing advertisement strategies through the Vneta ad-network.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Analysis and Modeling**: Python, pandas, pyrsm, Matplotlib
- **Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques**: Logistic Regression
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, seaborn
- **Version Control System**: Git

## Key Accomplishments

### Data Analysis and Preparation
- **Data Import and Segmentation**: Loaded data from a parquet file, creating training and test sets for model evaluation.
- **Exploratory Data Investigation**: Analyzed data to understand feature distributions and relationships.

### Model Building and Assessment
- **Logistic Regression Implementation**: Developed models to predict ad click probabilities using features like app type and user behavior.
- **Statistical Validation and Model Assessment**: Employed Chi-square tests and Pseudo R-squared evaluations to determine model fit and explanatory strength.
- **Feature Importance and Prediction Accuracy**: Investigated feature significance and model predictiveness with permutation importance and prediction plots.

### Strategic Ad Targeting Analysis
- **User Segmentation via Decile Analysis**: Classified users by predicted click probabilities to target high-potential segments.
- **Effectiveness Visualization via Gains and Lift Charts**: Illustrated the superiority of logistic regression over random targeting.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Conducted detailed comparisons of targeting strategies to evaluate profitability and return on marketing expenditure (ROME).

### Predictive Model Outcomes and Strategic Recommendations
- **Model Performance Comparison**: Compared the logistic regression model against a random baseline and Vnetaâ€™s proprietary model, focusing on accuracy and ROME.
- **Profitability and Efficiency Analysis**: Calculated expected profits and ROME for different scenarios, providing insights on effective ad targeting strategies.

## Project Impact
- **Targeting Precision Enhancement**: The logistic regression model significantly improved targeting efficiency, leading to higher click-through rates and optimized advertising spending.
- **ROI Improvement**: Demonstrated that targeted advertising using predictive modeling substantially increases return on investment compared to random targeting.
- **Strategic Business Advice**: Recommended adopting sophisticated data-driven ad targeting strategies to enhance user engagement and financial performance.
